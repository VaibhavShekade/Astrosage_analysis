# AstroSage Data Analysis — Excel Dashboard

## 🚀 Overview

This project provides an end-to-end operational analysis of the AstroSage platform using **Microsoft Excel**. It converts raw historical consultation data into actionable insights that help evaluate performance, profitability, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. The dashboard empowers business leaders to make strategic, data-driven decisions for scaling AstroSage’s services.

## 📌 Project Objective & Background

AstroSage is one of India’s largest astrology consultation platforms, offering services through calls, chats, and app-based interactions. With increasing customer engagement and platform expansion, AstroSage planned a **₹1 Crore investment** to enhance technology infrastructure and operational capacity. To justify this investment, a detailed analysis of customer behavior, agent performance, and revenue contribution was required.

## 🎯 Objective

**Optimize call center operations to improve efficiency, customer satisfaction, and profitability.**

The goal was to uncover platform usage patterns, evaluate service quality, identify top-performing astrologers, and pinpoint operational bottlenecks that restrict revenue growth.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Despite high traffic and strong business potential, AstroSage faced critical challenges:

| Challenge Area | Observation |
|----------------|------------|
| **Low Customer Satisfaction** | Average rating of **2.9** suggests dissatisfaction |
| **High Failed/Pending Consultations** | Large volume of incomplete, no-answer, and pending sessions |
| **Agent Performance Gaps** | Significant variability in astrologer ratings and consultation counts |
| **Single-Platform Dependency** | **72% traffic** coming from *Gurucool* creates operational risk |
| **Unclear Revenue Drivers** | Lack of visibility into which consultation types are most profitable |

These challenges reduced operational efficiency, hampered customer trust, and increased churn risk.
